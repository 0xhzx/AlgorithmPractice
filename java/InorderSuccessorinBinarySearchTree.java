Inorder Successor in Binary Search Tree  

Given a binary search tree (See Definition) and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

	Example 

	Given tree = [2,1] and node = 1:
	  2
	 /
	1


	return node 2.

	Given tree = [2,1,3] and node = 2:
	  2
	 / \
	1   3


	return node 3.

Note 
If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return null.

Challenge O(h), where h is the height of the BST.
